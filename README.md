## EDIT:

This code was written by me alone (https://github.com/Schmleh).

The original repository is private, as per verbal agreement with the clinicians for whom this was written.
This is a public version of that private repository, made with their permission;
however, all doctor and patient names have been removed, along with the program's actual function.

#### The code here represents only the program's GUI.

Note: this project only works when installed into Pcloud.
The file storage system is coded to store it's forms within certain folders on Pcloud.

Notes.java compiles into a GUI for filling out and recording patient visit information.
The GUI will record information on the location of the pain, and what medication
or treatment was applied. It will also allow the recording of multiple visits at once.

The information is stored within txt files, that can be viewed from within it's pcloud folder.
